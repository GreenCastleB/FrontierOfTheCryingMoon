Frontier of the Crying Moon
originally intended for Bite Size Game Jam February 2026 - https://itch.io/jam/bite-sized-game-jam
but not completed in time.

This is a very short RPG set in the old West where you are defending a town against an impending werewolf attack.
It was inspired mostly by Sunset's Chapter in Live-A-Live (Square, 1994)
